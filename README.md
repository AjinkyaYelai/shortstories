# ShortStories

## Interactive stories told through App Shortcuts and Notifications.

ShortStories provides a platform to play text-based games using the various elements of the Android System UI:

• <b>Notifications indicate scenarios in a story, posing a situation in which a choice is required</b>

• <b>App Shortcuts provide a means of making a choice, and making a choice poses a new scenario</b>

• <b>Dialogs provide a means of viewing a list of achievements, gained by exploring various paths in a story</b>

Unique colors, icons, vibration patterns and sounds exist for different types of scenarios and actions, and are used to theme the Notifications and App Shortcuts.

Stories are defined in XML. A basic structure of <b>Story</b>, <b>Choice</b>, <b>Achievement</b> and <b>Finish</b> tags allows ShortStories to parse and play almost any kind of text-based, multiple choice game.

Available on Android 7.1 (Nougat MR1) and above. Ensure that your launcher supports App Shortcuts (tested and works with Pixel Launcher, Google Now Launcher, Nova Launcher and Action Launcher).
