## Interactive stories told through App Shortcuts and Notifications

![Alt text](art/screenshots.png?raw=true "Screenshots")

ShortStories provides a platform to play text-based games using the various elements of the Android System UI:

• <b>Notifications indicate scenarios in a story, posing a situation in which a choice is required</b>

• <b>App Shortcuts provide a means of making a choice, and making a choice poses a new scenario</b>

• <b>Dialogs provide a means of viewing a list of achievements, gained by exploring various paths in a story</b>

Unique colors, icons, vibration patterns and sounds exist for different types of scenarios, and are used to theme the Notifications. Emoji provide a contextual icon for scenarios and choices.

Stories are defined in XML. A basic structure of <b>Story</b>, <b>Choice</b>, <b>Scenario</b>, <b>Achievement</b> and <b>Finish</b> tags allows ShortStories to parse and play almost any kind of text-based, multiple choice game.
