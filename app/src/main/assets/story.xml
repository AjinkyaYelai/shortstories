You follow him across the common area, through various alleyways and arrive at a small trapdoor.
You crouch, step through and work your way down a small spiral of stairs into a dimly-lit room.
You find the elderly Android standing in the centre of the room, pointing at six markings etched on the floor.

You wonder where you will be journeying to and how you will get there, but the excitement of it all overwhelms you.

&quot;Where am I?&quot; you wonder.
The general topography of the area feels familiar yet different, almost as if you have gone back in time.
You snap out of it and remember that your goal is to locate the sweet treats the elderly Android spoke of.
To your left lies a path that leads into a thick maze of trees.
To your right you notice a young Android dressed in unfamiliar clothes.
