You decide to put your Daydream away and head inside to the cafeteria.

Brussel sprouts is of one of the two staple foods in Plex.
While you chew on the tasteless, leafy substance, an elderly Android approaches you.
"Are you enjoying that?" he asks.

"There was a time when sweet confectioneries and delicious treats were in abundance!" he says.
"Come with me" he whispers, as he hurries out of the cafeteria with surprising speed.
You follow him across the common area, through various alleyways and arrive at a small trapdoor.
You crouch, step through and work your way down a small spiral of stairs into a dimly-lit room.
You find the elderly Android standing in the centre of the room, pointing at six markings etched on the floor.
They include a cylindrical shape, four thin bars and a small, badly-drawn oval.
"These drawings depict half of the sweet treats enjoyed by Androids many clock cycles ago" he says.
"Would you like to taste them for yourself?"

"I can offer one of my possessions to assist you on your sugary journey" he says.
You wonder where you will be journeying to and how you will get there, but the excitement of it all overwhelms you.
He holds out his hand, ushering you to choose one of three items.
Which one will you take?
                        </Scenario>
                        <Choice

Suddenly, you feel a magnetic pull as the floor seems to sink beneath your feet.
You catch a glimpse of the elderly Android waving goodbye as a blinding light engulfs you.
Before you can say 'Nexus' you land on a grassy patch of land, your image sensors adjusting back to normal light.
"Where am I?" you wonder.
The general topography of the area feels familiar yet different, almost as if you have gone back in time.
You snap out of it and remember that your goal is to locate the sweet treats the elderly Android spoke of.
To your left lies a path that leads into a thick maze of trees.
To your right you notice a young Android dressed in unfamiliar clothes.
What will you do?
                            </Scenario>

                                    scenario_type="0">You venture down the path, the foliage growing denser with every step.
At one point, you notice the floor crunch beneath your feet.
You find this a bit odd as the ground appears to be soft, due to the layers of leaves and mud.
At one point, the crunching sound is very audible.
You peer down and notice that specks of dark brown and white nestled between the grass.
The specks appears to lead in to a small opening in the trees.
What will you do?
                                </Scenario>

                                        scenario_type="18">As you reach the end of the path, a humming sound grows gradually louder.
Something buzzes past your ear.
You have a strong dislike for bugs.
"I'm lost" you mutter, noticing a dead end in front of you.
Your disappointment turns to fear as you look up in horror to see hundreds of winged creatures flying towards you!
You notice a small opening in the trees, a soft golden glow emanating from it.
Act fast!
                                    </Scenario>
                                    <Choice

Thankfully, your winged opponents do not follow you inside.
While catching your breath, you notice strange hexagonal openings in the walls.
The yellow glow of the room calms your nerves and you decide to inspect them.
Each hexagon appears to hold a thick, golden liquid.
Without thinking, you dip your finger in to one of them and taste it.
It's floral, sticky and sweet.
It's delicious, and unlike anything you have tasted before.
You have found the Honeycomb treat!
As you finish savouring on it, you feel the same magnetic pull that brought you to this place.
With a bright flash of light, you are pulled away and thrown back in to Plex.
Upon arrival, you seem to have only cached a vague memory of your adventure.
"Did I imagine that?" you wonder.
Unsure of it all, you decide to relax for now and postpone thinking about it until lunch time.
You put on your Daydream headset...

You lean down, placing your hand next to the opening in order to peer in.
The plants give way and your lose your balance, falling into a small, hollow clearing.
Geometric shapes arranged in a circular pattern are marked on the muddy ground.
Dazed and a little confused, you look up to see a clear glass jar placed on a rock, like a shrine, in the middle of the area.
You cautiously approach it.
What will you do next?
                                    </Scenario>

You notice disc-like items in the jar, each dark brown in color with a milky white centre.
You extract one and feel compelled to take a bite.
It's chocolaty, crunchy and sweet.
It's delicious, and unlike anything you have tasted before.
You have found the mysterious 'O' treat!
As you finish savouring on it, you feel the same magnetic pull that brought you to this place.
With a bright flash of light, you are pulled away and thrown back in to Plex.
Upon arrival, you seem to have only cached a vague memory of your adventure.
"Was that real?" you wonder.
Unsure of it all, you decide to relax for now and postpone thinking about it until lunch time.

She turns around, startled but seemingly happy to see you.
"Hello! Who are you?" she says.
"I'm Andy" you reply.
You notice she is holding a small white container, holding a smooth substance that points up from the top.
"I've brought this along to enjoy, but I have nothing to eat it with" she declares.
"I'd offer you some if that weren't the case".
What will you do?

"Here we go, have the first taste" she says, holding up the container.
You take a scoop of the glossy substance place it in your mouth.
It's cold, creamy and sweet.
It's delicious, and unlike anything you have tasted before.
You have found the Froyo treat!
As you finish savouring on it, you feel the same magnetic pull that brought you to this place.
With a bright flash of light, you are pulled away and thrown back in to Plex.

"What is this place?" you wonder.
The general topography of the area feels familiar yet different, almost as if you have gone back in time.
You snap out of it and remember that your goal is to locate the sweet treats the elderly Android spoke of.

Before you can say 'Galaxy' you land with a splash in a rapid river.
"Help!" you yell with all of your speakers' might, but there is no one in sight.
You calm down and remember that your goal is to locate the sweet treats the elderly Android spoke of.
